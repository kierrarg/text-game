things I need to do:
-implement going to riomia and going straight to war


different endings:
- if diary is not read you go to war and videans betray you, everyone dies 
- if diary is true and confession is false
    - gungar tries to tell you war is a bad idea 
    - you go anyways (a command being that you're the royal heir)
    - you barely make it, your mother is murdered in the process
- if diary and confession are true
    -talk with gungar about traitors 
    -agree to meet with another nation instead of Vide for war
    -steal videan weapons and ships and go to other nation
    -meet with other nation and plan for war
    -go to war
